# Big data Pipline

## Business Logic
The goal of this project is to establish a machine learning pipeline in order to create a unit helping a bank exacutive to decide wether an application for loan is acceptable or should be rejected

## Model selection
in the model creation process a Logistic regression classifier and decision tree classifier were created and than saved for later used the one with higher precision

## Pipelines architecture

## technologies involved
* Spark (mlib and spark sql) 
* Hadoop HDFS
* Spring Boot
* Angular
* MongoDB

## Features Completed
* Batch process: Model generation
* API for prediction requesting and prediction history
* Front end appliction

## Uncompleted projects
* Streaming process

## Missing configs in this repository and future features to add
* Docker compose for containerizing the applications
* the pipeline is missing the definition of the project were the data gathering and preprocessing happens from an original source
